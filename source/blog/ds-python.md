# Introduction to Data Structures in Python

Data structures are the backbone of computer programming, allowing you to store and manipulate data efficiently. In this blog post, we'll introduce you to key data structures in Python and provide insights into their applications and usage.

## What Are Data Structures?

Data structures are a way to organize and store data to perform operations efficiently. Python provides several built-in data structures, including lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples. We'll cover each of these and more in this post.

## Common Data Structures

### Lists

A list is a collection of items that can be of any data type. It's mutable and ordered.

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 'hello', True]
```
